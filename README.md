# Feature Importance Algorithms Implementation

### Overview:
The goal of this project is to implement various feature importance algorithms, and get a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses in different contexts. The report discusses about some of details and path I've taken to accomplish the goal. 

The source code is in the _featimp.py_ file, we import it here to present some of the examples and visualizations.
